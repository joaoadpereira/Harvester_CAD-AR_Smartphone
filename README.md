### Motivation
The industry seeks new technologies and tools to achieve efficient solutions. When prototyping large and complex CAD models, it is essential that the design communication may be done in the most flexible and effective way, allowing to the different stockholders (e.g. designers, engineers, customers, professional users) with different backgrounds remain engaged. 

Augmented Reality is becoming available to everyone since a smartphone is a common gadget in our pockets. Using this so well-known tool in complex environments, as virtual prototyping, may facilitate the design communication and enlarge model reviewing. In the end, improved products may be achieved.

This project intends to display a CAD model in a smartphone with Augmented Reality technology.
